Repository for the Cell Migration Data

The Cell Migration WIS Repository is a community accessible cell migration data repository and knowledge-base, developed as part of the MULTIMOT project (https://multimot.org/), to capture, disseminate and support the multiscale analysis of cell migration data for biological and clinical applications. 

This open and free data exchange ecosystem for cell migration data is based on the development of extensible community standards by CMSO, the Cell Migration Standardisation Organisation.

Cell Migration Repository is at https://repo.cellmigration.org/

General description of who may deposite data, what can be deposited and how, can be found at https://repo.cellmigration.org/bin/help
